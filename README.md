# Machine Translation 🚀

Welcome to the **Machine Translation** repository! This project is focused on building a machine translation system using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📖 Project Overview

Machine translation is the task of automatically converting text from one language to another. In this project, we have implemented a translation system that leverages deep learning models and state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) architectures.

### Key Features
- Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and Transformer models.
- Supports multilingual translation tasks.
- Fine-tuned mBERT and GPT models for enhanced performance.
- REST API integration for easy deployment and scaling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using:

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** & **PyTorch**: For building and training NMT models.
- **spaCy** & **NLTK**: For text preprocessing.
- **mT5**: For multilingual text translation.
- **BERT** & **GPT-3**: For fine-tuning models.
- **Flask**: For REST API integration.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy
- Flask (if running the API)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruv7539/Machine-Translation.git
cd Machine-Translation

You can then send POST requests to test the translation system.

## 📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy in NLLB model compared to mBART, with notable improvements in translation quality when compared to traditional methods.

## 🧪 Testing
For unit testing, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
