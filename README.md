Machine Translation 🚀
Welcome to the Machine Translation repository! This project is focused on building a machine translation system using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

📖 Project Overview
Machine translation is the task of automatically converting text from one language to another. In this project, we have implemented a translation system that leverages deep learning models and state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) architectures.

Key Features
Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and Transformer models.
Supports multilingual translation tasks.
Fine-tuned mBERT and GPT models for enhanced performance.
REST API integration for easy deployment and scaling.
🛠️ Technologies Used
This project is built using:

Python
TensorFlow & PyTorch: For building and training NMT models.
spaCy & NLTK: For text preprocessing.
mT5: For multilingual text translation.
BERT & GPT-3: For fine-tuning models.
Flask: For REST API integration.
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and spaCy
Flask (if running the API)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dhruv7539/Machine-Translation.git
cd Machine-Translation
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Code
To run the notebook and train the models:

Open Code.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the steps to preprocess the dataset and train the models.
To test the REST API:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
You can then send POST requests to test the translation system.

📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy in [list the languages], with notable improvements in translation quality when compared to traditional methods.

🧪 Testing
For unit testing, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/
🛠️ Future Improvements
Adding more language support.
Improving model efficiency.
Deploying the model on a cloud platform for real-time translation services.
